# Magnets all around us!

Magnets are hidden in everyday use all around us. We use them to generate electricity, and drive our cars. Magnets are so simple, yet so incredibly important for modern life. They are hidden all around us. Come to this session to learn how magnets work, and even how to build your own electro-magnet with a nail, wire, and a small battery you can probably find around your house.
